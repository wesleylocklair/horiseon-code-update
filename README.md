# Horiseon Code Update

## In this project I made changes to a starter code of a website. Among these changes were changes to HTML elements. Inputting semantic elemants so the flow of code was easier to understand. I changed the projects title from webpage to Horiseon to add a cleaner, more professional look. I also gave more accessibility to the webpage by providing alt text for images. There is notes by everything I did so it is easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this and upgrading the code to a bettervisual experience.

## Credits
