# Horiseon Code Update

## In this project I made changes to a starter code of a website. Among these changes were changes to HTML elements. 
Inputting semantic elemants so the flow of code was easier to understand. I changed the projects title from webpage to Horiseon 
to add a cleaner, more professional look. I also gave more accessibility to the webpage by providing alt text for images. 
There is notes by everything I did so it is easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this and upgrading the code to a better
visual experience.

## Credits
I used this page to reference semantic elements for HTML.
